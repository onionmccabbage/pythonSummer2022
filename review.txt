Review Exercise
===============
Ask the user to enter a guess until they get it right (integer between 0 and 100)
  from random import randint # this is a good way to make a random number
  n = randint(0,100)

If it's too high or too low tell them
When they get it right the game ends
(NB validate that an integer was entered) 

Optional
--------
tell them how many guesses they took
entering -1 quits the game (tell them the answer)
entering -2 offers hints: is it even, is it odd, is it a square or prime number?
maybe ask the user for the range (i.e. the difficulty)

    primes_t     = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)


Recomended
----------
- use functions
- use booleans to check if the game is over
